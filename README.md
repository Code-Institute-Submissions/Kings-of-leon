Hi

Welcome to first of five milestone projects I will be creating. 
My brief was to creat to a fan page for a certian band, I decide to change that to a band was more fimaler with. 

The page is designed for people who are already fans of the kings of Leon but don't know all there songs or know much about them and hypicthical venue page were one could book the band to play live.
The styling I took inspiration from the KOL main page to help fit into the style of the band. http://kingsofleon.com/

There are five pages in total the main page with a large video to help get the user in the mood with a very up beat song with clips from the band on tour taken from youtube like the rest of the videos.

A video page that is split into two sides of moods that the band play, one rock the other more of slow romantic mood and then split again into live shows to give the user as much taste of the band on one page. 
I had orginally wanted to make this contrast more clear but decided against as it could cause a clash in styling. This page is designed to help the user understand the the many moods of the band while intorducing them to new songs they may not have heard of. 

The Music page is designed for the user to set back and enjoy the music with a carsoul of images of the band. 

The Venue page as menchioned above is to book the band for a live show, rather than say how much it would cost to book the band becuase that would no doubt expensive I opeted for simpler approach. The user puts in email address and picks from three optoins. 

The about page is brief history of the band and what there new album has achieved since its lanch. 
The information on the band was taken from Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Leon 

The deveopment of the Project. 
I used wireframes to get my idea of site together but through some styling difficulties some things had to be changed like the background. I had orginally chosen and black and white background with the band on a stage but this conflicted with the text and had to be removed. 
Bootstrap was a great help in getting the page set up and using the grid system provided help make the site responsive. 
There is some javascript in the code to help make properties that I took from bootstrap to work like the carsoul and the list of music buttons for the user. 

The Navagtion bar is fixed so the user is never lost and all the containtors when collasped all stack on top of each other. 
the Footer has all the links for the KOL social medai pages that take the user to another tab but insuring that they dont loose the orginal page. The footer has about page button that brings the user to the about page.
