# Kings of Leon fan page

# UX 
The band Kings of leon have many moods, I wanted to capture two of there many moods. This is a fan page with the idea that people could book the band 
for a venue. 
* There are two speeds of sound, I went with fast and slow. 
* The Home page: is get everyone in the mood with a live festival feel. 
* Video page: is a selection of four videos, two videos have an up beat tone and the other two a slower rythem. The videos are broken down into one fase, one slow, one live fast and one love slow.  
* Music page: A simple page of there music if a user does not want to watch there videos and just listen to music. With a simple side show of the group together. 
* Venue page: The user can enter in an email address and pick there venue for where they would like to band to play. 
* About page: The about page. All about how the band came to being and there latest album.

# Testing
The first idea for this project was to have two colour themes to go with types of music i.e. a red theme for there faster songs and blue one for there slower. 
I was advised that is might not be doable so I did two different types of moods on the video page. 
To insure that site was moblie friendly 
    I mimizsed the page and used the inspect feature to show different deavices with the page.
    There is a bug with the burger button that I refer to below that I wasn't able to fix. 

The home page I have tested the video works and all the social media link buttons bring me to the banks sites. 

The video page I did the same as the home page video but since I built the page and time of submission one of the four videos does not work and will need to be replaced. 

The music page
    When I first attached the music to page there was no way of pausing the song or mutting it. 
    I had to add a mute button and play and pause buttons for the user to be able to listen to the songs. 
    
    The carsole didn't work the fisrt time I used it as I had script jquary at the header instead of the footer. 
        Clicking on the carsoul buttons to insure that it changes to the next image and waiting a few seconds to see if it does automatically. 

The venue page
    As there is no backend to this project there is no way of accepting the an email address or creating a profle.
    All the venues can be chosen and I tested this by clicking through each one. 
    By clicking the submit button the user is taken to there default email provider. 

Some bugs I wasn't able to fix is the footer colour and the burger white lines do not show when the page is reduced down. 
    I tried styling the burger button rentering the code but could not get it to change.
